"Overview
Introduction
Our Soccer API provides real-time game updates and a vast database of supplementary statistics for the largest leagues in the world. Data is collected via Sportradar on-venue scouts and in-house operators.

650+ unique competitions are available in one package. See our Coverage Matrix for a detailed breakdown of competitions and data offered.

The Soccer API is consistent in structure, format and behavior with the other General Sport APIs. Primary feeds will return seasons, competitions, team/player data and real-time scores.

Additional feeds provide a host of complementary stats, including:

Live standings for top leagues
League leaders
Win probabilities for every match
Lineups with formations
Seasonal statistics
Season leaders
Missing/Injured players
Live ball-spotting data (x,y coordinates for events on the field)
Head-to-head statistics
Fun facts
Additional packages include:

An enhanced API package containing Extended Stats
Two delivery Push Feeds to enhance speed (real-time customers only)
Soccer Probabilities. This add-on includes in-game probability updates and season outrights.

üóùÔ∏è
Authentication is required for all API calls.

API Map
To best utilize the Soccer v4 API, you will need several parameters to create your API calls. The map below illustrates how you can obtain the parameters you need.

Primary and mapping feeds only require dates, human-readable parameters or a Competition Id (which can be found in the competitions endpoint), while other feeds require a global unique identifier (GUID) to identify the sport event, competitor, or player that the feed will describe. The primary feeds provide GUIDs for sport events, competitions, and competitors, while sport event and competitors provide GUIDS for players.

Failover Info
If our scout feed goes down or becomes unavailable, Sportradar takes over Live Data Entry (LDE) to provide a failover.

In case of a failover, we follow one of the following scenarios:

We are unable to provide deeper player or team stats, such as shots, corners, assists, and offsides. We will deliver only basic stats and events such as goals, cards, and substitutions with player names.
